# In this workshop, we will expand on some of the basic functions, use tidyverse more and introduce some archaeology specific functions
# It will follow the flow of a more typical data analysis workflow
# We will work with data about lithics from the Jerimalai rockshelter in East-Timor
# This workshop has been inspired by the 'tidyverse for archaeologists' workshop by Professor Ben Marwick 

# Load the tidyverse package
library(tidyverse)

# This data is coming from an URL, and it is an excel file. We unfortunately cannot use tidyverse to read excel files, so we will use the rio package
# Install the rio package
# install.packages("rio")
library(rio)

# Load the data using import
data <- import("https://bit.ly/j_data_xlsx", setclass = "tbl_df")

# We can now create a histogram of the Weight column. This will show how many artefacts have a certain weight
# We can do this using the ggplot() function. This function takes a tibble, and creates a plot.
# ggplot works with layers. We can add these layers with a + sign.
# The base command is ggplot(). This creates a white canvas, and you can add information that is passed to the layers.

ggplot(plotting_data)

# As we want to make a histogram, we only need to specify the x axis

ggplot(plotting_data, aes(x = Weight))

# Now we need to add a layer that displays the data. These layers are known as geoms. There are many different geoms, but we want to create a column plot, so we will use the geom_histogram() function.

ggplot(plotting_data, aes(x = Weight)) +
  geom_histogram()

# There are some weights that are very large, but most are close to zero.
# If we change the x axis scale to a logaritmic scale, we can see the distribution better
# We do this by adding the scale_x_log10() layer

# A logarithm is a mathematical function that increases slowly at first, and then faster and faster. This is useful for data that has a large range, as it compresses the data and makes it easier to see the distribution.
# This specific logarithm is the base 10 logarithm, which means that 10 is raised to the power of the number on the x axis. For example, 10^2 = 100, so the number 2 would be at the position 100 on the x axis.

logs_tibble <- tibble(x = c(10^0, 10^1, 10^2, 10^3, 10^4), y = c("10^0", "10^1", "10^2", "10^3", "10^4"), z = log10(x))

# We now only want to keep rows that have the "A" value for the Square column
